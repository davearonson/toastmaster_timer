This is a timing program intended mainly for Toastmasters speeches,
and similar purposes.

Features:

- Lets you enter a minimum and maximum time, in minutes

- Click START button to start, STOP to stop, and RESET to reset time
  (STOP does not reset, so you can use it to pause)

- Shows elapsed time, and time remaining

- Changes background color to show the status (starts blue, turns
  green at minimum, yellow halfway from minimum to maximum, red at
  maximum)

- Text area shows "minimum" when that has been achieved, "halfway"
  halfway between minimum and maximum, and "overtime" after maximum

- Lets you enter grace periods, above and below, in seconds

- Text area shows "Qualified" when within grace period below minimum,
  and "Disqualified" when exceeding grace period above maximum

- Lets you hide the exact time and status, and show only the color
  ("contest mode")

Since Github won't serve up raw HTML as such (rather than show it to you), you
can use it at:

It's been a while since I've done anything with this.  I know I should make the
JS "unobtrusive", and probably use CSS to change the colors and such, but I
didn't know about those things when I wrote this, around 2005 or so.
